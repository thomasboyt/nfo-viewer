A Node-based NFO viewer that converts [code page 437](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437) to a Unicode approximation.

To use, put your NFOs in `nfos/` in the same folder (I suggest grabbing a few off of [textfiles.com](http://textfiles.com/piracy/)), and visit `localhost:3000/<filename>` to view.
